						<h2>My Story</h2>
						<h3>Lifelong Learner. Wife. Mother. Business-Communications Professional.</h3>
						<p>I must say that I am truly grateful and content in all that I do. I wear many hats and am happy to be constantly evolving. This blog is a place where I will share my thoughts and observations about family, work and life in general.</p>

						<p>First and foremost, I consider myself to be a child of God and my personal faith journey has led me to discover that in this current phase of my life it is my family and being able to provide for them that motivates and drives me forward each day. In addition to being an industry professional, having earned my Masters in Business Administration and Bachelors of Science in Communications, I am most blessed to be a Mother to two bright young souls and a Wife to a wonderfully supportive husband. Fulfilling my two important roles as I provide for and serve my family means that taking inventory of of priorities and lifelong goals is an ongoing practice and helps me keep everything in perspective. Ultimately, my greatest responsibility to raise up my two daughters and help them grow up to realize their greatest potential in life is the role I take most seriously and I appreciate every moment while striving for work life balance.</p>

						<p>Regarding my work, which is mainly focused on results-driven communications through marketing and advertising, since 2007 my career has grown into a true passion which I enjoy sharing with others. My experience is deeply rooted in the world of marketing agency work. Around the same time I landed my first job with a firm that specialized mainly in serving financial institutions as clients, I began my role as a junior level account executive just as the social media landscape began opening up to brand marketers. I’ve had the great opportunity to witness and be involved in this evolution while simultaneously adapting, supporting and assisting dozens of clients. Thanks to this work experience, I have an appreciation for industry compliance and am poised with the ability to help financial brands navigate these issues. Gratefully, I am currently working on the client side for a wonderfully community focused financial institution that serves customers throughout Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire. I appreciate that my career has come full-circle for me to focus all of my background experience and knowledge on one amazing brand - Enterprise Bank.</p>

						<p>In addition to a large portion of my career that has focused so much on financial industry clients over the years, I have also enjoyed working with retail brands as well as community based nonprofits use their social media sites as a springboard for earned media opportunities. Helping organizations discover their voice and establish relevant online audiences on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and other networking sites has been its own reward. Bottom line — I enjoy strategy.</p>

						<p>As a professional, I believe in making the most of earned media opportunities in combination with and paid media placements. Providing brands with insightful reporting and measurable influence is one of the things I do best.</p>
